Nmap is already installed and ready to use in Kali Linux. You can start using it by opening the terminal and typing `nmap` followed by the desired options and target.

Here's an example of using Nmap to scan a target IP address:

```bash
nmap <target_ip>
```

Replace `<target_ip>` with the IP address of the target you want to scan. This command will perform a basic port scan and display the open ports and services running on those ports.

Nmap has a vast array of options and features that you can explore based on your specific requirements. It's a powerful tool for network security and can be a valuable asset in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment efforts.

Remember to use Nmap responsibly and ethically, as it should only be used for authorized and lawful purposes.

Here's an example command to scan a target IP address with additional options:

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -A <target_ip>
```

This command will perform a more comprehensive scan, including service and version detection, script scanning, and aggressive scanning. It will provide a detailed report of the target's network configuration and security posture.
