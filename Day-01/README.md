# Cybersecurity Notes

## Network Address Translation (NAT)
  - Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method used in networking that allows one IP address to be mapped to another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. This technique enables multiple devices on a local network to use a single public IP address to access the internet, which conserves the number of public IP addresses an organization or ISP must use. It also adds a layer of security by masking internal IP addresses.

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
  - ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It's a network protocol used to find the hardware (MAC) address of a host from its known IP address. It is used when a device wants to communicate with another device on a local network and needs to resolve the IP address to a MAC address.
